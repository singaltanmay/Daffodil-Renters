# Daffodil-Renters
This is a project that implements the backend of a housing / real-estate app
to be used by the employees of a company to find a place to live near work. 
In this project I performed complex queries by performing operations on different
tables in the database at once in order to fetch useful data.
It makes extensive use of Java Concurrency elements such as forked-join pools to
improve multi-threaded performance while also maintaining database integrity and thread safety.
